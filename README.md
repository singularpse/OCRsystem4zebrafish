## A newly developed feeder and oxygen measurement system reveals the effects of ageing and obesity on metabolic rate in zebrafish
The data for oxygen consumption and movement distance were imported and analysed automatically using customised R software. It has been published under the GNU General Public License, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.

#### The data for oxygen consumption and movement distance were imported and analysed automatically using customised R software.
1.	Download the latest version of R from www.r-project.org
2.	Download the latest version of Rstudio from www.rstudio.com
3.	Download supplement_automatic_analysis_byR.Rmd.
4.	Prepare raw data and place these files into the same directory as supplement_automatic_analysis_byR.Rmd.
5.	Press the kint button in Rstudio and get data visualization report.

#### The automatic feeding system was controlled by a micro-controller Arduino UNO as shown in Fig. 5A. Given that the actuation time of the feeding device could be precisely controlled by the micro-controller, the quantity of food and the feeding time could be freely customised by using the software to meet specific needs.
To install and run the customised automatic feeding system:
1.	Download the latest version of Arduino IDE from www.arduino.cc
2.	Download supplement microcontroller program.
3.	Assemble your circuit according to the diagram shown in Fig.5A.
4.	Upload microcontroller program to Arduino Uno board in Arduino IDE.
